## Objective

Create a service to proxy service running locally to the public URL.
It Should be fully functional and interactive.

The resulting command might look like this:

```bash
reverprox 3000 api
```

### Features

- Ability to configure the remote server URL
- Build on QUIC protocol
- Supports only HTTP proxy
- Ability to specify the subdomain to use for the public URL

### Assumptions

- We will use QUIC
- The service will be written in rust
- We might use the daemon that runs locally
- We might add ability to configure daemin using CLI

## MVP

- Ability for client to start a Bidirectional connection to the QUIC server
- Accept HTTP requests from the server
- Forward reqeusts to the local server `localhost:3000`
- Wait for the response from the local server
- Send the response back to the QUIC server
- Server that accepts the QUIC connection from the Client
- Accepts HTTP Requests from the known public DNS `api.reverprox.com`
- When new Request comes in, it should be able to find the client that is connected to the server and forward the request to it
- Send the HTTP reqeust over QUIC
- Recieve the HTTP response from the client
- Send response back to the requester

## Scope

- QUIC server that runs in the cloud
- QUIC client that runs locally
- Client configuration parsing
- Commands to initialize the connection and to configure client
- Client on initialization sends the init request to the server to establish the **long-lasting** connection
- Server needs to make regular Health checks to the client
- Server needs to support a list of clients (connections)
- Server needs to get the request from the client and send back the HTTP response to it

### Server

- Ability to generate TLS certificate
- Store Connections
- Connection health checks
- Interface for receiving requests
- Interface for sending requests
- Deconding.Encoding I/O
- the HTTP interface
- Send/Filtrate HTTP requests to the QUIC server
- SECURITY
  ...

### Client

- Send initialization request
- Long Lasting Bidirectional connections
- Parse the configuration
- Get the running local server details
- Ability to close the connection
- Filtrate the incomming messages
- CLI Interface
- Local Server health checks
- Ability to keep the connection in a suspended mode to then reopen it
- SECURITY
  ...
